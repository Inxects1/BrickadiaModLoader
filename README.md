## Download & Installation

### For Users (Easy Way)

1. **Download** the latest `BrickadiaModLoader.exe` from the releases
2. **Run** the executable - no installation needed!
3. That's it! The mod loader is ready to use.

**Note:** For RAR file support, you may need to install [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/download.html) on your system.

### For Developers (Running from Source)

1. Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed
2. Install the required dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:

```powershell
python main.py
```

### Building the Executable

To build your own executable, use the provided build script:

```powershell
cd scripts
.\build_exe.ps1
```

Or manually:

```powershell
python -m PyInstaller scripts\BrickadiaModLoader.spec
```

The executable will be created in the `dist` folder.

## Usage

2. **First Time Setup:**

   - Click the "⚙ Settings" button
   - Set the path to your Brickadia Paks folder (usually something like `C:\Program Files\Brickadia\Brickadia\Content\Paks`)
   - Set the path where you want to store your mods (default is in your home directory)
   - Click "Save Settings"

3. **Installing Mods:**

   - Drag and drop a .zip or .rar file containing .pak files into the drop zone
   - Or click "Browse for Archive" to select a file
   - The mod will be extracted and added to your mod list

4. **Managing Mods:**
   - **Enable**: Select a mod and click "Enable Mod" to activate it (copies to Brickadia folder)
   - **Disable**: Select a mod and click "Disable Mod" to deactivate it (removes from Brickadia folder)
   - **Delete**: Select a mod and click "Delete Mod" to permanently remove it

## For Mod Creators 🛠️

Want to make your mods look great in the mod loader? You can add custom metadata!

### Adding Custom Mod Information

Create a `modinfo.json` file in your mod archive alongside your .pak files:

```json
{
  "name": "My Awesome Mod",
  "description": "This mod adds cool new features to Brickadia!",
  "author": "YourName",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "icon": "icon.png"
}
```

### Supported Fields

- **name**: Display name for your mod (shown in the mod list)
- **description**: Brief description of what your mod does
- **author**: Your name or username
- **version**: Version number (e.g., "1.0.0", "2.1.3")
- **icon**: Path to an icon image file (PNG recommended, will be displayed at 48x48 pixels)

### Icon Guidelines

- **Format**: PNG, JPG, or other common image formats
- **Size**: Any size (will be automatically resized to 48x48)
- **Recommended**: 256x256 or 512x512 for best quality
- **Location**: Include in the same archive as your .pak file

### Multi-File Mods

The mod loader automatically handles mods with multiple files! If your mod includes:

- `.pak` - Main mod file
- `.ucas` - Unreal Engine asset file
- `.utoc` - Unreal Engine table of contents
- `.sig` - Signature file
- `.ini` - Configuration file
- `.txt` - Documentation or readme

Just include them all in your archive with the same base name (e.g., `MyMod.pak`, `MyMod.ucas`, `MyMod.utoc`), and the mod loader will handle them all together when enabling/disabling.

### Example Mod Structure

```
MyAwesomeMod.zip
├── MyAwesomeMod.pak
├── MyAwesomeMod.ucas
├── MyAwesomeMod.utoc
├── MyAwesomeMod.sig
├── modinfo.json
└── icon.png
```

### Complete modinfo.json Example

```json
{
  "name": "Ultimate Build Tools",
  "description": "Adds 50+ new building tools and shortcuts for advanced builders",
  "author": "BuildMaster",
  "version": "2.3.1",
  "icon": "icon.png"
}
```

### Testing Your Mod

1. Create your mod archive (.zip or .rar)
2. Include all necessary files (.pak, .ucas, etc.)
3. Add your `modinfo.json` and icon
4. Test by dragging into the mod loader
5. Check that your icon and info display correctly

## How It Works

1. When you install a mod, the loader extracts any .pak files (and related files) from the archive
2. All mod files are stored together in a dedicated folder in your mods storage location
3. When you enable a mod, all its files are copied to your Brickadia Paks folder
4. When you disable a mod, all its files are removed from the Brickadia Paks folder (but kept in storage)
5. All mod states and metadata are tracked in a `mods.json` file

## Configuration Files

The mod loader stores its configuration files in your mods folder:

- `[Mods Folder]/config.ini` - Stores your Brickadia installation path and mods storage location
- `[Mods Folder]/mods.json` - Keeps track of all installed mods and their states

**Default Location:** `%USERPROFILE%\BrickadiaModLoader\Mods\`

This keeps all mod-related data organized in one place!

## Troubleshooting

**Q: The application won't start**

- Make sure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check that you have Python 3.7+: `python --version`

**Q: RAR files won't extract**

- Install WinRAR or the unrar library
- Make sure WinRAR is in your system PATH

**Q: Mods aren't showing up in game**

- Make sure you've set the correct Brickadia Paks folder in Settings
- Verify that the mod is enabled (shows "✓ Enabled" in the status column)
- Restart Brickadia after enabling mods

**Q: Can't find Brickadia Paks folder**

- Look for: `<Brickadia Install Location>\Brickadia\Content\Paks`
- Common locations:
  - `C:\Program Files\Brickadia\Brickadia\Content\Paks`
  - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Brickadia\Brickadia\Content\Paks`

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- tkinterdnd2 (for drag & drop)
- rarfile (for RAR extraction)
- WinRAR or UnRAR (for RAR support)
