## For Mod Creators üõ†Ô∏è

Want to make your mods look great in the mod loader? You can add custom metadata!

### Adding Custom Mod Information

Create a `modinfo.json` file in your mod archive alongside your .pak files:

```json
{
  "name": "My Awesome Mod",
  "description": "This mod adds cool new features to Brickadia!",
  "author": "YourName",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "icon": "icon.png"
}
```

### Supported Fields

- **name**: Display name for your mod (shown in the mod list)
- **description**: Brief description of what your mod does
- **author**: Your name or username
- **version**: Version number (e.g., "1.0.0", "2.1.3")
- **icon**: Path to an icon image file (PNG recommended, will be displayed at 48x48 pixels)

### Icon Guidelines

- **Format**: PNG, JPG, or other common image formats
- **Size**: Any size (will be automatically resized to 48x48)
- **Recommended**: 256x256 or 512x512 for best quality
- **Location**: Include in the same archive as your .pak file

### Multi-File Mods

The mod loader automatically handles mods with multiple files! If your mod includes:

- `.pak` - Main mod file
- `.ucas` - Unreal Engine asset file
- `.utoc` - Unreal Engine table of contents
- `.sig` - Signature file
- `.ini` - Configuration file
- `.txt` - Documentation or readme

Just include them all in your archive with the same base name (e.g., `MyMod.pak`, `MyMod.ucas`, `MyMod.utoc`), and the mod loader will handle them all together when enabling/disabling.

### Example Mod Structure

```
MyAwesomeMod.zip
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MyAwesomeMod.pak
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MyAwesomeMod.ucas
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MyAwesomeMod.utoc
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MyAwesomeMod.sig
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ modinfo.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ icon.png
```

### Complete modinfo.json Example

```json
{
  "name": "Ultimate Build Tools",
  "description": "Adds 50+ new building tools and shortcuts for advanced builders",
  "author": "BuildMaster",
  "version": "2.3.1",
  "icon": "icon.png"
}
```

### Testing Your Mod

1. Create your mod archive (.zip or .rar)
2. Include all necessary files (.pak, .ucas, etc.)
3. Add your `modinfo.json` and icon
4. Test by dragging into the mod loader
5. Check that your icon and info display correctly

## How It Works

1. When you install a mod, the loader extracts any .pak files (and related files) from the archive
2. All mod files are stored together in a dedicated folder in your mods storage location
3. When you enable a mod, all its files are copied to your Brickadia Paks folder
4. When you disable a mod, all its files are removed from the Brickadia Paks folder (but kept in storage)
5. All mod states and metadata are tracked in a `mods.json` file

## Configuration Files

- `config.ini` - Stores your Brickadia installation path and mods storage location
- `mods.json` - Keeps track of all installed mods and their states

## Troubleshooting

**Q: The application won't start**

- Make sure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check that you have Python 3.7+: `python --version`

**Q: RAR files won't extract**

- Install WinRAR or the unrar library
- Make sure WinRAR is in your system PATH

**Q: Mods aren't showing up in game**

- Make sure you've set the correct Brickadia Paks folder in Settings
- Verify that the mod is enabled (shows "‚úì Enabled" in the status column)
- Restart Brickadia after enabling mods

**Q: Can't find Brickadia Paks folder**

- Look for: `<Brickadia Install Location>\Brickadia\Content\Paks`
- Common locations:
  - `C:\Program Files\Brickadia\Brickadia\Content\Paks`
  - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Brickadia\Brickadia\Content\Paks`

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- tkinterdnd2 (for drag & drop)
- rarfile (for RAR extraction)
- WinRAR or UnRAR (for RAR support)
