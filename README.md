### For Users (Easy Way)

1. **Download** the latest `BrickadiaModLoader.exe` from the releases
2. **Run** the executable - no installation needed!
3. That's it! The mod loader is ready to use.

**Note:** For RAR file support, you may need to install [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/download.html) on your system.

### For Developers (Running from Source)

1. Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed
2. Install the required dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:

```powershell
python main.py
```

### Building the Executable

To build your own executable:

```powershell
python -m PyInstaller --name="BrickadiaModLoader" --onefile --windowed --hidden-import=tkinterdnd2 --hidden-import=rarfile --hidden-import=zipfile --collect-all=tkinterdnd2 main.py
```

Or use the provided build script:

```powershell
.\build_exe.ps1
```

The executable will be created in the `dist` folder.

## Usage

2. **First Time Setup:**

   - Click the "‚öô Settings" button
   - Set the path to your Brickadia Paks folder (usually something like `C:\Program Files\Brickadia\Brickadia\Content\Paks`)
   - Set the path where you want to store your mods (default is in your home directory)
   - Click "Save Settings"

3. **Installing Mods:**

   - Drag and drop a .zip or .rar file containing .pak files into the drop zone
   - Or click "Browse for Archive" to select a file
   - The mod will be extracted and added to your mod list

4. **Managing Mods:**
   - **Enable**: Select a mod and click "Enable Mod" to activate it (copies to Brickadia folder)
   - **Disable**: Select a mod and click "Disable Mod" to deactivate it (removes from Brickadia folder)
   - **Delete**: Select a mod and click "Delete Mod" to permanently remove it

## How It Works

1. When you install a mod, the loader extracts any .pak files from the archive
2. These .pak files are stored in your custom mods folder
3. When you enable a mod, the .pak file is copied to your Brickadia Paks folder
4. When you disable a mod, the .pak file is removed from the Brickadia Paks folder (but kept in storage)
5. All mod states are tracked in a `mods.json` file

## Configuration Files

- `config.ini` - Stores your Brickadia installation path and mods storage location
- `mods.json` - Keeps track of all installed mods and their states

## Troubleshooting

**Q: The application won't start**

- Make sure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check that you have Python 3.7+: `python --version`

**Q: RAR files won't extract**

- Install WinRAR or the unrar library
- Make sure WinRAR is in your system PATH

**Q: Mods aren't showing up in game**

- Make sure you've set the correct Brickadia Paks folder in Settings
- Verify that the mod is enabled (shows "‚úì Enabled" in the status column)
- Restart Brickadia after enabling mods

**Q: Can't find Brickadia Paks folder**

- Look for: `<Brickadia Install Location>\Brickadia\Content\Paks`
- Common locations:
  - `C:\Program Files\Brickadia\Brickadia\Content\Paks`
  - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Brickadia\Brickadia\Content\Paks`

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- tkinterdnd2 (for drag & drop)
- rarfile (for RAR extraction)
- WinRAR or UnRAR (for RAR support)
