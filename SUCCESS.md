## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Windows SmartScreen Warning

Users might see "Windows protected your PC" when first running:

- This is normal for new executables
- Click "More info" → "Run anyway"
- This happens because the .exe isn't digitally signed

### Antivirus False Positives

Some antivirus software may flag PyInstaller executables:

- This is a known false positive
- The code is completely safe (you wrote it!)
- Users can add an exception or scan the file

### RAR File Support

- .zip files work out of the box
- .rar files require WinRAR installed
- Most users already have WinRAR
