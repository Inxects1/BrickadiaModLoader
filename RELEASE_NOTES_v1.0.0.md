## 🚀 How It Works

### On First Launch:

1. App checks for updates from GitHub
2. If no Brickadia path is configured, shows setup wizard
3. Wizard auto-detects Brickadia or lets user browse
4. Automatically finds Paks folder inside selected directory
5. User clicks Continue and is ready to use!

### On Every Launch:

1. Checks GitHub API for latest release
2. Compares version tags
3. If newer version exists, prompts user to download
4. Opens browser to releases page if user accepts
5. Shows instructions for updating

## 📝 Technical Details

### Update Check:

- Uses GitHub API: `https://api.github.com/repos/Inxects1/BrickadiaModLoader/releases/latest`
- Compares semantic version numbers
- 5-second timeout to prevent hanging
- Graceful failure if offline or API unavailable

### Auto-Detection:

- Checks multiple common installation paths
- Reads Windows Registry for Steam installation
- Validates by looking for `Brickadia/Content/Paks` folder
- Supports both direct install and Steam versions

### Setup Wizard:

- Modal window prevents interaction with main app
- Can't be closed without completing setup
- Real-time path validation
- Handles alternate directory structures
